# ConcurrentProg
 
 Distributed, parallel and concurrent programs. Multithreading.
• Distributed and shared memory in the communication.
• Shared memory in multithreading: execution stacks and the heap.
• Defining and starting threads: class Thread and interface Runnable.
• Operations of class java.lang.Thread.
• Life cycle of threads.
• Blocking operations.
• Scheduling and context switches.
• Interference among threads. Race condition. Thread safety.
• Monitors.
• The role of volatile.
• Synchronization provides atomicity, mutual exclusion, and visibility of memory
operations.
• Check-then-act. Invariant involving more than one variable.
• The role of final fields. Immutable objects.
• Data structures. Iteration.
• Producer–consumer systems.
• Synchronizers (latch, barrier, semaphore). Future.
• Threads versus tasks. Thread-pool, ExecutorService.
• The wait–notify mechanism.
• Deadlock, livelock, starvation.
• Explicit locks. Readers–writers synchronization.
